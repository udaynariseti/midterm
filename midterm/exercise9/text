Ubuntu Mobile Internet Device Edition 
was an Ubuntu distribution planned to run on the Intel Mobile
Internet Device platform, x86 mobile computers based on the Intel Atom processor. 
It was planned to use the GNOME 
framework Hildon as the basis for its GUI.
Equipment producers would have been able to customize their distributions, 
including options such as Flash, Java, or custom interfaces.[1]
Ubuntu Mobile has stopped development in 2009 and the successor Ubuntu for phones was announced on January 2, 2013.[2][
