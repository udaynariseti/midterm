fails for some reason (for example, if it can't create the destination file), or if the arguments aren't correctly
specified (for example, wrong number of arguments, or more than two arguments and the last one isn't a directory). 
In the case of grep, an exit status of zero (success) is returned if it finds the specified pattern in at least one 
of the files; a nonzero value is returned if it can't find the pattern or if an error occurs (the arguments aren't 
correctly specified, or it can't open one of the files).
In a pipeline, the exit status is that of the last command in the pipe. So in
who | grep fred
the exit status of the grep is used by the shell as the exit status for the pipeline. 
In this case, an exit status of zero means that fred was found in who's output
(that is, fred was logged on at the time that this command was executed).
The $? Variable
